# CarLeasingCalculator
The Car Leasing Calculator is a web application that helps users estimate the total leasing cost, monthly installment, down payment, and interest rate for leasing a car. The calculator takes into account the car type (brand new or used), car value, lease period, and down payment percentage.

The project consists of the following files:
- `index.html`: The main HTML file containing the structure of the calculator
- `styles.css`: The CSS file for styling the calculator
- `script.js`: The JavaScript file for implementing the calculator logic
